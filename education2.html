	<p><font color="black"><font size="5"> Moist Heat Therapy vs. Dry Heat Therapy</p>
	<p><font size="4">Moist heat therapy is more effective than dry heat therapy because it penetrates more deeply, which increases the beneficial effect on muscles, joints, and soft tissue.  A warm compress or hot water bottle may relieve pain and ease stiffness by relaxing muscles.  Dry heat, such as electric heating pads and saunas, draw out moisture from the body and may leave the skin dehydrated.  Moist heat therapy helps soothe a wide variety of muscular ailments and is the perfect solution for all types of stress, pain, and tension.  Customers report that our moist heat therapy products have been integral in the treatment of an assortment of ailments from daily stress reduction and sports injury therapy to quadriplegic pain and even autism therapy. Kawai Therapy products made by Warm Buddy are generally recommended to use as heat therapy for muscle strains and general relaxation.  Moist heat increases circulation to the area and speeds recovery by bringing in fresh blood cells and removing waste.  If one has just experienced and injury and swelling, bruising, or inflammation is present, cold therapy is the preferred application by most during the initial 48 hours after the injury.</p> </body> </div>
